    - if username and password are NOT provided
      - ClientError function is called with 2 arguments (status code, message)
      - jumps to ./client-error.js file where the ClientError class is being executed
      - exports the return of the ClientError class back to index.js file and the remaining stack is thrown
    - if username and password ARE provided
      - server calls the hash method of the argon2 object on the password
      - the username and hashed password gets stored in an array
      - and the query method of db object gets called with an INSERT statement using the arrays as values
      - the database then runs the INSERT statement
      - returns the result to the server
