  - when the client(user) opens the website, index.jsx executes
  - index.jsx renders the app.jsx component
    - constructor gets defined
    - render method gets returned
      - the return also calls the renderPage function
      - function checks the path of the URL sign-up path is truthy
        - returns Auth component
          - jumps to the auth.jsx file where the render method of AuthPage class gets called
          - condition is checked to determine welcome message
          - returns a react div element that also contains a jsx component (AuthForm)
            - jumps to auth-form.jsx where AuthForm component gets executed
              - constructor gets defined and render method is called
              - whenever the user types, the onChange event listener method gets called with the handleChange method
              - handleChange method updates the state of the username and password
              - when user submits the form, the onSubmit event listener gets called with the handleSubmit method
              - handleSubmit method fills in the request method, headers, and body with the state object
              - calls the fetch method with the approprite route (sign-up)
              - fetch sends a request to '/api/auth/sign-up' with new user and password
              - the server checks the request body to ensure there is a username and password property/values
                - if username and password are NOT provided
                  - ClientError function is called with 2 arguments (status code, message)
                  - jumps to ./client-error.js file where the ClientError class is being executed
                  - exports the return of the ClientError class back to index.js file and the remaining stack is thrown
                - if username and password ARE provided
                  - server calls the hash method of the argon2 object on the password
                  - the username and hashed password gets stored in an array
                  - and the query method of db object gets called with an INSERT statement using the arrays as values
                  - the database then runs the INSERT statement
                  - returns the result to the server
                  - responds back to the client with a status code and a json string of and object within an array containing
                    userId, username and createAt properties/values
                - if an error occurs at any given point, the server calls the catch method
                  - server finds and calls the the next middleware (errorMiddleware)
                  - jumps to the error-middleware.js file where the errorMiddleware is executed
                    - function checks which instance the error belongs to and server sends out the status code / message
User can sign in.
  - sign-in is similar to sign-up except sign-in path of renderPage function is truthy which also returns Auth component
  - Auth component contains AuthForm component, which functions the same as sign-up
  - fetch instead sends a request to '/api/auth/sign-in' with user and password
  - similar to sign-up, server checks the body for username and pasword, throws and error if it's missing
  - if valid then the server sends a sql SELECT statement to return the userId/hashedPassword where the username matches in the db
  - if NO results, then ClientError function gets thrown
  - if there IS results, then the sign-in password is hashed like in sign-up
  - if the hashed passwords does NOT match then ClientError is thrown
  - if it does matched then the userId and username gets stored in an 'payload' object
  - the sign method of the jwt object gets called with 2 argument (payload object and the secret token)
  - finally the server responds with the signed token and payload object
  - also similar to sign-up, if an error occurs at any given point then the catch method is called
    - error gets passed to the neext middleware (errorMiddleware) and returns an error message
